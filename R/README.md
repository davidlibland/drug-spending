## R

All R scripts and notebooks are here! Organizational structure:

- `analysis-vis`: Analyses and visualizations
- `apps`: Shiny app files (subfolder for each)
- `d4ddrugspending`: Anything that could be put in an R package - for example, functions to join specific datasets in our project
- `datawrangling`: Dataset-specific scripts to collect and clean

Note that data.world has an [R client](https://github.com/datadotworld/data.world-r)! This makes it easy to import data directly from our repo there.
