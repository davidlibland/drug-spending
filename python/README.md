## Python

All Python scripts and notebooks are here! Organizational structure:

- `analysis-vis`: Formal analyses and visualizations
- `apps`: Flask app files
- `d4ddrugspending`: Anything that could be put in an importable library - scripts to read data, eg
- `datawrangling`: Dataset-specific scripts to collect and clean
- `notebooks`: Exploratory notebooks/tutorials

Note that data.world has a [Python client](https://github.com/datadotworld/data.world-py)! Great for importing datasets directly from our repo there.
